# NLP-MLOps Pipeline

The NLP-MLOps Pipeline project focuses on integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to create a robust and scalable system for deploying and maintaining NLP models. This project aims to bridge the gap between the development and production stages of NLP applications, ensuring seamless model updates, performance monitoring, and efficient resource utilization.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of the NLP-MLOps Pipeline is to automate the deployment and lifecycle management of NLP models. This includes the steps from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and continuous monitoring. By leveraging MLOps principles, the project ensures that NLP models can be updated and maintained with minimal manual intervention, reducing downtime and improving model performance over time.

## Key Components

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
    - Cleaning and transforming raw text data into a format suitable for model training.
    - Techniques: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

2. **Model Training:** 
    - Training various NLP models, including traditional machine learning models and advanced deep learning architectures.
    - Models: BERT, GPT, LSTM networks.

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** 
    - Automating the testing and deployment of models to ensure quick and reliable production updates.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:** 
    - Continuous monitoring for performance metrics such as accuracy, latency, and resource usage.
    - Implementing logging mechanisms to track model predictions and identify potential issues.

5. **Scalability:** 
    - Designing the system to scale horizontally, allowing for multiple models across distributed environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Docker:** Containerization for consistency across development, testing, and production.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestration of containerized applications for managing scaling and deployment.
- **TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch:** Libraries for building and training machine learning models.
- **Git:** Version control for code and model artifacts.
- **Jenkins/GitLab CI:** Tools for automating the CI/CD processes.
- **Prometheus/Grafana:** Monitoring and visualization of system and model performance metrics.

## Applications

The NLP-MLOps Pipeline can be applied to various real-world scenarios, including sentiment analysis, chatbots, recommendation systems, and text classification tasks. By integrating NLP with MLOps, organizations can ensure their NLP applications are robust, scalable, and continuously improving.

This project demonstrates how modern MLOps practices can be effectively applied to NLP workflows, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of deploying NLP models in production environments.
